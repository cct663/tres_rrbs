# Summary

This repository contains all the code needed to reproduce analyses, figures, and the manuscript for 'Corticosterone exposure causes long-term changes in DNA methylation, physiology, and breeding decisions in a wild bird.' Metadata for the paper and data for some analyses are also included in the repository. The sequencing data used for methylation analyses and for genome assembly can be accessed from NCBI and details are included in the manuscript. 

All of the code for analyses is included in the '1_main_rrbs_script.R' file with extensive annotation throughout the file.

The file '2_rrbs_manuscript.rmd' reproduces the full manuscript and supplementary materials along with figures and tables derived from the main code analyses.

A version of this analysis is permanently archived at Zenodo.
